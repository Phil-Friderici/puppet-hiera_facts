### deeper_merge

Type: Ruby 3.x API

Recursively merges two or more hashes together and returns the resulting hash.

For example:

    $hash1 = {'one' => 1, 'two' => 2, 'three' => { 'four' => 4 } }
    $hash2 = {'two' => 'dos', 'three' => { 'five' => 5 } }
    $merged_hash = deeper_merge($hash1, $hash2)
    # The resulting hash is equivalent to:
    # $merged_hash = { 'one' => 1, 'two' => 'dos', 'three' => { 'four' => 4, 'five' => 5 } }
    $hash1 = { 'key1' => [ 'arrayvalue1', 'arrayvalue2' ] }
    $hash2 = { 'key1' => [ 'arrayvalue2', 'arrayvalue3' ] }
    $merged_hash = deeper_merge($hash1, $hash2)
    # The resulting hash is equivalent to:
    # $merged_hash = { key1' => [ 'arrayvalue1', 'arrayvalue2', 'arrayvalue3' ] }

When there is a duplicate key that is a hash, they are recursively merged.
When there is a duplicate key that is an array, they are recursively merged with duplicates removed.
When there is a duplicate key that is not a hash or an array, the key in the rightmost hash will "win

#### `deeper_merge()`

Recursively merges two or more hashes together and returns the resulting hash.

For example:

    $hash1 = {'one' => 1, 'two' => 2, 'three' => { 'four' => 4 } }
    $hash2 = {'two' => 'dos', 'three' => { 'five' => 5 } }
    $merged_hash = deeper_merge($hash1, $hash2)
    # The resulting hash is equivalent to:
    # $merged_hash = { 'one' => 1, 'two' => 'dos', 'three' => { 'four' => 4, 'five' => 5 } }
    $hash1 = { 'key1' => [ 'arrayvalue1', 'arrayvalue2' ] }
    $hash2 = { 'key1' => [ 'arrayvalue2', 'arrayvalue3' ] }
    $merged_hash = deeper_merge($hash1, $hash2)
    # The resulting hash is equivalent to:
    # $merged_hash = { key1' => [ 'arrayvalue1', 'arrayvalue2', 'arrayvalue3' ] }

When there is a duplicate key that is a hash, they are recursively merged.
When there is a duplicate key that is an array, they are recursively merged with duplicates removed.
When there is a duplicate key that is not a hash or an array, the key in the rightmost hash will "win
