## Functions

### deeper_merge

Type: Ruby 3.x API

Recursively merges two or more hashes together and returns the resulting hash.

For example:

    $hash1 = {'one' => 1, 'two' => 2, 'three' => { 'four' => 4 } }
    $hash2 = {'two' => 'dos', 'three' => { 'five' => 5 } }
    $merged_hash = deeper_merge($hash1, $hash2)
    # The resulting hash is equivalent to:
    # $merged_hash = { 'one' => 1, 'two' => 'dos', 'three' => { 'four' => 4, 'five' => 5 } }

When there is a duplicate key that is a hash, they are recursively merged.
When there is a duplicate key that is not a hash, the key in the rightmost hash will "win
